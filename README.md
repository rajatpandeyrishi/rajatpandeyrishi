# üí´ About Me
I‚Äôm a developer from India, and honestly, my journey into coding has been more about learning who I am than just learning how to code.

Coming from a computer science background, I was always surrounded by tech ‚Äî lectures, assignments, theory. But the real connection with code didn‚Äôt happen in a classroom. It happened slowly, when I started exploring things on my own‚Ä¶ building small projects, getting stuck, fixing bugs at 2 AM, and feeling that quiet joy when something finally worked.

What started as curiosity slowly became something I deeply cared about ‚Äî not because it was trendy, but because I found meaning in it. I started enjoying the process of building things from scratch, solving real problems, and just creating something that didn‚Äôt exist before. That still feels kind of magical.

I‚Äôve had days where I felt lost, questioned myself, even thought of giving up. But somewhere in all that mess, I‚Äôve learned to be patient with myself. To treat every mistake as a part of the process.

Now when I sit down to code, I don‚Äôt just see logic or syntax ‚Äî I see possibilities. And if you're someone who's just starting or feeling stuck, I only want to say this; you don‚Äôt need to have it all figured out. Just take one step, one line, one idea at a time. You‚Äôll be surprised how far that can take you.‚ú®
